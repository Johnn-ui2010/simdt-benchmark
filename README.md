# Benchmarking Operators and Joins
 
The objective of our study is to investigate whether SIMD can improve the equi-join performance in SGX.\
The source code is divided into two parts. Please open the corresponding folders for further details and experiment results. \
The [first part](/simd_microbenchmarks/README.md) shows our microbenchmark results. There we evaluated single operators. \
In the [second part](/simd_join_benchmarks/README.md), we examined the join performance.
